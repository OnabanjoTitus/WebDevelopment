        <h3 class="aboutText">For more than 5 years now, design has been the central piece oof my world.
            <br>
            on this fast and mind-blowing journey, i have moved over the years
            <br>from being a visual designer to a full time UX/UI thinker and designer.
            <br><br>At the moment, this journey has brought me to US Mobile where i am a
            <br>full-time Senior Product Designer. In this position, as with freelance,
            <br>I am working remotely and i have been for approximately two years.
            <br>
            <br>
            With the constant goal of pushing design boundaries and maintaining a
            <br>high standard for usability & user experience, i have consistently
            <br>worked with various startups and clients from all around the world
            <br>and helped them create amazing and engaging digital products
